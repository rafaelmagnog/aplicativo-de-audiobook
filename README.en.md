A simple and interactive **audiobook player**, developed as part of the **JavaScript Bootcamp** by [Hashtag Dev](https://www.hashtagtreinamentos.com/).

The project simulates an audio player that allows the user to **play, pause, skip, and go back between chapters** of a literary work.  
All audio files were downloaded **strictly for educational purposes** and have no commercial use.

## 🧠 Purpose

The main goal of this project was to **practice DOM manipulation with JavaScript**, integrating HTML, CSS, and pure JS to build a functional and interactive application.  
Throughout the project, the following concepts were applied:

- Selecting and manipulating elements using `getElementById`;
- Handling events with `addEventListener`;
- Dynamically updating content (`innerText`, `classList`);
- Conditional logic and modular functions;
- Front-end code organization and best practices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — Application structure  
- **CSS3** — Styling and responsive layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** — Logic and player interactivity
